# Saving/ investing scenarios app 

This is R code for a shiny web app that allows users to input different values for typical investing scenarios and visualize the return that they would be able to make.

Please adjust the sliders in order to modify the different parameters and select whether or not you want the plot to be a facetted plot or not. 

You can also access the shiny web app directly [here](https://dhruv-krishnaswamy.shinyapps.io/Workout2_Dhruv_Krishnaswamy/)
